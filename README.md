# Anthea's Quest

This is a small RPG written in Rust. I had written the first version in React Native (see https://github.com/JPMoresmau/anthea-quest-rpg). This one is using RLTK (https://github.com/thebracket/rltk_rs) and Specs (https://github.com/amethyst/specs). I describe the world (NPCs, items, etc.) in a RON file.

It's in very early form, it doesn't have a combat system yet!!
